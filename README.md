# Healthcare Staffing Demand Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

* Motivation: The United States has an influenza season, during which more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop severe complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to treat these extra patients adequately. The medical staffing agency provides temporary staff. 
* Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season. 

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Analyze staffing demand trends over time
* Identify peak demand periods and potential understaffing risks
* Support data-driven workforce planning and scheduling decisions according with the most vulnerable population
* Provide clear insights for operational and administrative stakeholders

## 🗂️ Data Source

* CDC - The Influenza deaths by geography data is based on death certificates for U.S. residents and includes 10-year age groups. The cause of Death database contains mortality, and population counts for all U.S. counties from 2009 to 2017. 
* US Census Bureau. contains the total number of people living in each State and town from 2009 to 2017, including population demographics such as age and gender.
  
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Excel** (advanced analysis and reporting)
* **Tableau** (data visualization and dashboards)
* Descriptive statistics and trend analysis

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Data cleaning and validation
3. Time-based analysis of staffing demand
4. Identification of peak periods and variability
5. Visualization of demand trends
6. Interpretation of findings for operational planning

## 📊 Key Insights 

* Staffing demand shows clear needs for the olderly population
* Certain periods require higher staffing coverage to maintain service levels
* Data-driven scheduling can reduce understaffing risks

## 📈 Visualizations

* Staffing demand over time
* Peak demand periods by department or service area
* Comparative views of staffing levels vs. demand

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Categorize each state based on its vulnerable population count. (High, medium, and low)
* Deploy medical staff early in high-risk states, particularly from October to February
* Expand the vulnerable population to include all individuals 65+, not just 85+
* Train your staff to work with high-risk elderly people
* Expand Data sources, including hospital admissions and emergency visits records, to enhance decision making
* Refine future responses by analyzing the most recent data (2013 - 2017) and running predictive modeling
* Continue monitoring flu activity and adjust staffing levels in real time (CDC)
* Identify vaccination policies and care capacity per region
* Coordinate with local healthcare facilities to validate staffing needs and confirm capacity constraints
